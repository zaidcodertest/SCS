# SCS
new look into layouts,
making it look more straight forward.
The only usefull files here for now are the programming files (such as .cpp), you can ignore everything else.
just now that a pre-compiled executable file is available in SCS/compiled/ if you do not know how to or too confused to compile the programming files.
